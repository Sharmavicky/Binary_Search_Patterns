# Binary Search Patterns in C++

This folder contains C++ implementations of various binary search patterns commonly used to solve algorithmic problems.

## Patterns Covered

- Basic Binary Search ([BasicBinarySearch.cpp](BasicBinarySearch.cpp))
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array ([RotatedSortedArray.cpp](RotatedSortedArray.cpp))
- Find First and Last Position ([FirstLastPosition.cpp](FirstLastPosition.cpp))
- ...and more

## How to Run

Compile and run any pattern file using a C++ compiler:

```sh
g++ PatternName.cpp -o PatternName
./PatternName
